Problem 4. Explain the difference between a primary and foreign key.
*************************************************************************


Primary Key
------------------------
A primary key is a field or combination of fields that uniquely identify a record in a table,
so that an individual record can be located without confusion.



Foreign Key
------------------------
A foreign key (sometimes called a referencing key) is a key used to link two tables together.
Typically you take the primary key field from one table and insert it into the other table where
it becomes a foreign key (it remains a primary key in the original table).
