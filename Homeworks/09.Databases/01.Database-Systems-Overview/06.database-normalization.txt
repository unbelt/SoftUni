Problem 6. What is a certain database schema normalized?
*************************************************************


Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes
and tables of a relational database to minimize data redundancy.
Normalization involves refactoring a table into smaller (and less redundant)
tables but without losing information; defining foreign keys in the old table
referencing the primary keys of the new ones. The objective is to isolate data
so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made
in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using
the defined foreign keys.


A typical example of normalization is that an entity's unique ID is stored
everywhere in the system but its name is held in only one table.
The name can be updated more easily in one row of one table.
A typical update in such an example would be the RIM company changing its name to BlackBerry.
That update would be done in one place and immediately the correct "BlackBerry" 
name would be displayed throughout the system.
