Problem 12. What is a NoSQL database?
*****************************************

NoSQL encompasses a wide variety of different database technologies
that were developed in response to a rise in the volume of data stored
about users, objects and products, the frequency in which this data is accessed,
and performance and processing needs. Relational databases, on the other hand,
were not designed to cope with the scale and agility challenges that face modern applications,
nor were they built to take advantage of the cheap storage and processing power available today.
